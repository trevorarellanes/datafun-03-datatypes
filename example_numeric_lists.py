LIST METHODS ............................................... 

Here are some common methods that operate on an instance of a list.

append(x): Add an item to the end of the list.
extend(iterable): Add all the items from an iterable (such as another list)
     to the end of the list.
insert(i, x): Insert an item at a given position.
remove(x): Remove the first occurrence of an item.
pop([i]): Remove the item at the given position in the list, 
    and return it. If no index is specified, 
    removes and returns the last item in the list.
clear(): Remove all items from the list.
index(x[, start[, end]]): Return the index of the first occurrence of
     an item.
count(x): Return the number of occurrences of an item.
sort(key=None, reverse=False): Sort the items in the list 
     in ascending order.
reverse(): Reverse the order of the items in the list.
copy(): Return a shallow copy of the list.

"""

# append an item to the end of the list
lst = [1, 2, 3]

# extend the list with another list

# insert an item at a given position (0 = first item)
i = 0
newvalue = 42

# remove an item

# Count how many times 111 appears in the list

# TRANFORMATIONS ............................

# FILTER and MAP are critical in big data applications

# Use the built-in function filter() anywhere you need to filter a list
# Filter the new list to only include scores greater than 100
# You could pass in a named function, but honestly this is easier
# Say "keep x such that x > 100 is True" given new_scores
# Cast the result using square brackets to get a list
scores_over_100 = [filter(lambda x: x > 100, new_scores)]

# Use the built-in function map() anywhere you need to transfrom

# Map each element to its square
# Say "map x to x squared" given new_scores
# Cast the result using square brackets to get a list
doubled_scores = [map(lambda x: x * 2, new_scores)]

# Map each element to its square root
# Say "map x to the square root of x" and cast to a list
sqrt_scores = map(lambda x: math.sqrt(x), new_scores)

# Map each element (radius) to its area
radius_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Say "map r to pi r squared" and cast to a list
area_list = [map(lambda r: math.pi * r * r, radius_list)]


# TRANFORMATIONS - Using List Comprehensions
# List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists
# They work like map and filter, but are more concise
# They are the preferred "pythonic" way to do transformations

# With comprehensions, we start with what we WANT
# Filter the new list to only include scores greater than 100
# Say "keep x (for each x in new_scores) IF  x > 100"
scores_over_100 = [x for x in new_scores if x > 100]

# Try again "keep x (for each x in new_scores) IF  x < 42"
scores_under_42 = [x for x in new_scores if x < 42]

# Map each element to its square
# Say "give me x squared (for each x in new_scores)"
doubled_scores = [x * 2 for x in new_scores]

# Map each element to its square root
# Say "give me the square root of x (for each x in new_scores)"
# and cast it to a list using square brackets
sqrt_scores = [math.sqrt(x) for x in new_scores]

# Map each element (radius) to its area
# Say "give me pi r squared (for each r in radius_list)"
# and cast it to a list using square brackets
area_list = [math.pi * r * r for r in radius_list]

# Map each element (radius) to its circumference
# Say "give me 2 pi r (for each r in radius_list)"
# and cast it to a list using square brackets
circumference_list = [2 * math.pi * r for r in radius_list]
