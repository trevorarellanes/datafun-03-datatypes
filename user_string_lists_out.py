"""Below we will look at using python buid in functions on the text strings
let's look at the length of some of the lists

The length of list_nurses: 5
room_assign: 7
room_assign: 5

Next we will look at using the set() function
To find unique values in the room assign list we can make it a set.
The set of room assign is: {129, 133, 112, 144, 115, 119, 122}

[('Grant', 112), ('Frank', 115), ('Hannah', 119), ('Maeve', 122), ('Melanie', 133)]    

Next we examine merging nurses with physiological systems
[('Grant', 'neurological'), ('Frank', 'musculoskeletal'), ('Hannah', 'cardiovascular,')]
